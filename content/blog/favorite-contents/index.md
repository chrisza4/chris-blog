## [Tradable Quality Hypothesis](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TradableQualityHypothesis.html)

Martin Fowler put good content on why we might wrongly perceive internal quality and design as trade-offs for cheaper development. I agree that just like how we can buy a lower quality phone for lower prices, we can make a lower external quality software (eg. Non-performance critical. Non-optimal user interface) for the sake of lowering budget. However, it will be different story when it comes to internal quality.

I am not saying that we must over-engineer everything we build. I think we need to be aware that buying cheaper mobile with fewer features and buying ill design software for a cheaper budget, let it be time or money, is not comparable in many ways.
