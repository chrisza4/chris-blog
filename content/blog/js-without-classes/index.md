title: SOLID Javascript without Classes
---

I gave a talk in [Javascript Bangkok](https://javascriptbangkok.com/). It is about how you can use SOLID principle in Javascript without classes and objects.

My main motivation is to show the root of SOLID. I believe we can gain deeper understanding of what is an essence of SOLID and what is just simply an implementation, by looking at another manifestation of SOLID principle.

Looking back, I still love the content, but I could work more on presentation esp. the tone of voice and body language.
