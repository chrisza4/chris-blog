title: Critics on Modern frontend criticism

At this moment I see so many apparently veteran developers criticize modern frontend development as being overly and unnecessary complex. And I want to say few things about these criticism.

As one of the complain I found is basically about "these new frontend devs just keep creating new framework without any basic knowledge of computer programming", so let me explain a little bit of my experience and where I'm coming from.

## Frontend

I used to build frontend in production with these tools:

- WinForm, Visual Studio and C#
- Silverlight application, using good old WPF
- Objective-C
- Swift
- HTML, Javascript, CSS, Jquery
- Built my own mini SPA framework from JQuery
- AngularJS (Angular 1)
- React
- React Native with physics engine
- Vue

And in my little side project, I managed to build and experiment with Phoenix Liveview and HTMX.

## Backend

For production experience:

- Java
- JavaScript & TypeScript
- PHP
- Ruby
- Elixir
- Python
- C#

And for side projects (which you can see in Github):

- Rust (Love it!)
- Scala
- Clojure (love it!)

So you can see that I build program in many paradigm, OOP, functional. I can build a software in a hacky way (thanks PHP) and for payment gateway which accuracy is everything.

With this out of the way, let start by what I agree with critics

- You don't need any modern frontend framework for building blog or form-based application. This blog itself just using React because I was experiment on Gatsby and I am too lazy to change at this point. I still develop my own course registration system fully in Elixir with server side rendering, not even with LiveView.
