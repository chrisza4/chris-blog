title: Critics on Modern frontend criticism

At this moment I see so many apparently veteran developers criticize modern frontend development as being overly and unnecessary complex. And I want to say few things about these criticism.

As one of the complain I found is basically about "these new frontend devs just keep creating new framework without any basic knowledge of computer programming", so let me explain a little bit of my experience and where I'm coming from.

## Frontend

I used to build frontend in production with these tools:

- WinForm, Visual Studio and C#
- Silverlight application, using good old WPF
- Objective-C
- Swift
- HTML, Javascript, CSS, Jquery
- Built my own mini SPA framework from JQuery
- AngularJS (Angular 1)
- React
- React Native with physics engine
- Vue

And in my little side project, I managed to build and experiment with Phoenix Liveview and HTMX.

## Backend

For production experience:

- Java
- JavaScript & TypeScript
- PHP
- Ruby
- Elixir
- Python
- C#

And for side projects (which you can see in Github):

- Rust (Love it!)
- Scala
- Clojure (love it!)

So you can see that I build program in many paradigm, OOP, functional. I can build a software in a hacky way (thanks PHP) and for payment gateway which accuracy is everything.

With this out of the way, let start by what I agree with critics

- You don't need any modern frontend framework for building blog or form-based application. This blog itself just using React because I was experiment on Gatsby and I am too lazy to change at this point. I still develop my own course registration system fully in Elixir with server side rendering, not even with LiveView.
- Too many new frontend devs should know more about fundamental of HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript. There will be nuance to this take later though.
- Too many projects unnecessarily adopt frontend framework inappropriately.
- The whole NPM ecosystem is crazy.
- Keeping up with frontend community these days can be very exhausting. This, I totally sympathize with.

Now, let me take on things that I half-agree with:

## Frontend devs should stop learning framework and learn fundamental

I agree with this take but I think too many people don't even know what they are asking for when they said this.

## Frontend devs keep rediscover and rebrand the old pattern

I mean, I agree with this but is it even a thing to complain about?

## Most of the work we do don't really required modern frontend stack

Chicken and egg.

And here are takes that I absolutely disagree with

## Frontend back in the day is way simpler

## Frontend devs are forcing everyone to use modern frontend

I think this is totally misplaced anger.
