I will share it here.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TradableQualityHypothesis.html\">Tradable Quality Hypothesis</a></h2>\n<p>Martin Fowler put good content on why we might wrongly perceive internal quality and design as trade-offs for cheaper development. I agree that just like how we can buy a lower quality phone for lower prices, we can make a lower external quality software (eg. Non-performance critical. Non-optimal user interface) for the sake of lowering budget. However, it will be different story when it comes to internal quality.</p>\n<p>I am not saying that we must over-engineer everything we build. I think we need to be aware that buying cheaper mobile with fewer features and buying ill design software for a cheaper budget, let it be time or money, is not comparable in many ways.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TradableQualityHypothesis.html\">Link</a></p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-forgotten-history-of-oop-88d71b9b2d9f\">The Forgotten History of OOP</a></h2>\n<p>Eric Elliot is one of the functional programming advocates. He wrote a great article about what OOP was initially supposed to be. This article is great content that captures the original idea of OOP.</p>\n<p>I am not a person who always advocates for any “Original stuff”. I firmly believe that, in general, the extended version of anything will be better than the original version. But in the OOP case, I agree with Alan Kay that the real value of the Object-oriented paradigm comes from multiple subsystems communicate via message instead of shared memory. Our industry emphasizes design pattern, base classes, and inheritance tree shy us away from the deep and real merit of OOP design.</p>\n<p>It does provide value to a certain degree. But if we apply Pareto’s 80/20 rules here, I would say inheritance and base class design provides the 20% side.</p>\n<p>I should write on this more sometimes. I touch the surface of this topic in the article <a href=\"https://dev.to/chrisza4/composition-over-inheritance-1ojg\">Composition over Inheritance</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"My favorite blogs","date":"January 24, 2021","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/js-without-classes/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"SOLID Javascript without Classes"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/rewriting-dillema/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The software rewrite dilemma"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"57d635f7-b3fe-5efb-8a2c-d1f2af74b361","previousPostId":"609d816e-dc20-56d4-9bd6-2b49101b078e","nextPostId":"c2ac8394-61fc-5b09-86d5-4ead8f8abaeb"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1033745147","2841359383"]}
