I will share it here.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TradableQualityHypothesis.html\">Tradable Quality Hypothesis</a></h2>\n<p>Martin Fowler put good content on why we might wrongly perceive internal quality and design as trade-offs for cheaper development. I agree that just like how we can buy a lower quality phone for lower prices, we can make a lower external quality software (eg. Non-performance critical. Non-optimal user interface) for the sake of lowering budget. However, it will be different story when it comes to internal quality.</p>\n<p>I am not saying that we must over-engineer everything we build. I think we need to be aware that buying cheaper mobile with fewer features and buying ill design software for a cheaper budget, let it be time or money, is not comparable in many ways.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"My favorite blogs","date":null,"description":null}},"previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/new-beginnings/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Why I blog here."}}},"pageContext":{"id":"57d635f7-b3fe-5efb-8a2c-d1f2af74b361","previousPostId":null,"nextPostId":"dd0f3b7a-fd4f-5006-a695-d372def86385"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1033745147","2841359383"]}
