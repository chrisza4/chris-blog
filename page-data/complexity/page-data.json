Because my sentiment toward someone claim that we have unnecessary complexity usually goes like this.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: All I want to say here is more often than not, people deemed system to be “too complex” based on their familiarity and skillset. And I think that is very unfair.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Re: <a href=\"http://evrl.com/devops/cloud/2020/12/18/serverless.html\">Back to the ’70s with Serverless</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/oqxw3j/back_to_the_70s_with_serverless/h6gtw32?utm_source=share&#x26;utm_medium=web2x&#x26;context=3\">Original reply</a></p>\n<p>I don’t really understand how managing VPS can be simpler than Serverless. What is the definition of complex?</p>\n<p>I can deploy my apps into Serverless within few minutes. And with VPS, I need to ensure I have the right version of Linux, dependencies installed with correct versions and proper resources (CPU, Ram, Disk) + uptime monitoring.</p>\n<p>I can manage VPS dependencies and stuff with some tools like Ansible, but how it that provide a better feedback loop? It’s so slow compared to Serverless.</p>\n<p>If you are already familiar with all Linux commands, concepts, and toolsets, everything I mentioned will be easy and “feel simple” to you. But that is <a href=\"https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/\">easy, not simple</a>. And it applied only to you.</p>\n<p>Even if we don’t go with Rich Hickey’s definition of simple, you still need to take a layman’s perspective if you want to claim a system is easy. I would like to see how fast junior developers can get VPS up and running with the same quality as Serverless.</p>\n<p>Sometimes I feel like an old programmer complaint goes like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Senior: Back in the day, everything was simpler with stack X</li>\n<li>Junior: That is interesting. Let me learn X.</li>\n<li>Senior: You need to read this big book, and it takes a year of experience</li>\n<li>Junior: Wait, but how can X be simpler than new shiny toy A that I can learn and get it run within 10 minutes?</li>\n<li>Senior: You lack fundamental young Padawan. Once you dig into X long enough, you will understand how good X is.</li>\n<li>Junior: Wait, are we still talk about how X is simpler than A?</li>\n<li>Senior: Kid these days… so entitled and soft.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Maybe this is a classic case for the (curse of knowledge)[<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge</a>].</p>\n<p>By the way, I am also a fan of Erlang/Elixir ecosystem, but I strongly disagree with “running Erlang cluster is simpler than Kubernetes”. For a start, there are very few resources online. I figured out how to do Elixir code hot-reload using <a href=\"https://github.com/edeliver/edeliver\">edeliver</a> and I cannot even find out how to do some simple stuff until I dig into some kind of hidden Webboard and mailing group.</p>\n<p>Funny enough end, I found it easier for someone like me, without years of OTP experience, to run Elixir apps in Kubernetes cluster and achieve hot-reload from K8S stack. Of course, this is conceptually sucks since I am fully aware that OTP is much more potent and powerful than Kubernetes in many things. But in the end, I have some apps to deploy.</p>\n<p>I want to point out that the resource I found when I googled “Hot Code Reload Deployment Elixir” ended up <a href=\"https://gvaughn.github.io/2020/05/17/why_hot_deploys_are_cool.html\">recommend me to not fully rely on it</a>. So while I agree that Erlang and OTP is technically way more powerful and more amazing than new shiny toy such as Kubernetes, I strongly disagree with it being simpler.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Is this too complex?","date":"July 25, 2021","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/interruption-attitude/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Toward solving interruption in Programming"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/microservice-start-not-start/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Start with Microservices.
